    Counters are sequential circuits which output value, determined at every clock cycle, follows a specified sequence. In this exercice, you are asked to design a basic incremental counter in Verilog.

    Your circuit will be driven by the clock signal **clk** and the reset signal **reset**. The output **out** signal size will be determined by a **unique parameter** of your circuit. Your counter must be set to zero after reset and increment by 1 until overflow.

            Implement the counter module starting with the following signature :

            .. code:: verilog

                module counter(clk, reset, out)
